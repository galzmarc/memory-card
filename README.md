## A fun memory game using Pokémons!

Built using React (hooks) and <a href="https://pokeapi.co">PokeAPI</a>.

- Currently for desktop only (it works on mobile too, but the screen rendering is messed up).

## Game Walkthrough

1. Click on each card once, but don't click twice!
2. Clicking on a card causes the deck to shuffle, to make things more interesting.
3. Once all cards have been clicked, you move on to the next level, with new Pokémons and more cards!
4. Play and try to set a new highscore!

## Known issues and Todos

- Some cards are repeated across levels
- Does not work on most mobile devices yet

## Acknowledgements
